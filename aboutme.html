                Hello! My name is Riddhi, it's a pleasure to meet you. 
                I am a CS Alumna from Rutgers University. During my time at Rutgers, I have studied Data Structures & Computer Algorithms, A.I., 
                Machine Learning fundamentals, Database Management, Data Management, and Data Science.
                Furthermore, I am a developer interested in website, mobile development, while working on pursuing Data Science as a career. 
                During my free time, I enjoy drawing, playing video games, spending time with my friends, and watching anime or TV shows. 
                A fun fact about me is that I am a huge Pokemon fan.
