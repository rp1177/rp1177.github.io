            <p1 style="font-size:20px">
                Right now, I’m pouring my time and coding passion into projects that revolve around Data Analysis and Data Science fundamentals. I pick projects based on the intriguing questions I want to answer or problems I’m excited to solve. As I dive into these projects, I’m not just expanding my knowledge, but also turning my findings into something tangible - like a deployable app or a web interface. Below, you’ll find a list of my projects along with their respective repositories. If they’re ready for the world to see, I’ve included a website link!

            <p1 style="font-size:15px">
                After getting the hang of content and collaborative filtering, I thought it’d be cool to build my own anime recommendation system. Crunchyroll’s slow UI and Netflix’s limited anime options were kind of a bummer. So, I made MyAniMate to find new animes for myself.  However, the system has a limitation where the dataset only expands up to 2023 user ratings and animes.

                <li><b>Notebook:</b><a href="https://github.com/rp1177/AnimeRecommendation/blob/main/AnimeRecSystem.ipynb">Click here</a></li> 
                <li><b>Language used:</b> Python/Jupyter Notebook</li> 
                <li><b>Libraries used:</b> Fuzzywuzzy, Ipyplot, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nltk, Numpy, and Scikit-learn</li>
                <li><b>Development Process:</b>
                    <ul style="line-height:170%">
                        <li>1.) Downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and loaded it into a DataFrame.</li>
                        <li>2.) Initiated data cleaning and preprocessing, focusing on handling null values and ensuring data quality.</li>
                        <li>3.) Used a heatmap to visualize missing values, decided to ignore them to avoid introducing biases.</li>
                        <li>4.) Performed feature engineering by merging genres, synopsis, and TV-ratings into a ‘tags’ column using NLP techniques.</li>
                        <li>5.) For content based filtering, calculated similarity scores using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.</li>
                        <li>6.) For collaborative based filtering, developed a popularity metric column using weighted overall scores and number of favorites.</li>
                        <li>7.) Combined the average 'tags' content score with popularity score, multiplied by the weights.</li>
                        <li>8.) Implemented a user-input interface allowing user to give an input list of favorite animes which finds the average score and frequent genre.</li>
                        <li>9.) Subtract user's average score against the rest of the scores. The top 30 smallest difference in scores will be recommended to user.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><b>Future Developments:</b> Currently testing different weights and use cases of the recommendation system. In addition to that, a website is still under construction.
