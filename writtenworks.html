                Here are some academic writings that I have written during my time as in undergraduate so far. Outside of studying Computer
                In science, I wanted to explore other subjects such as media studies and understanding the philosophy of our minds 
                with machines. I aim to expand on my academic-related writings as a graduate student in the future.

            <h2 class="subheader1">ChatGPT-- For better or For Worse?</h2>
            <p2 style="font-size:18px">
                In November 2022, a new type of artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT, is trained on data models to generate new material. 
                The chatbot is owned and operated by OpenA.I., an A.I. startup company supported by Microsoft since 2019. Since its public launch, the chatbot has accumulated one million users. 
                Currently, the A.I. application is used by at least 13 million people every day. A.I. experts believe that the monthly cost of maintaining ChatGPT will reach about $3 million as its user base grows.

                Even though ChatGPT has power and resources, the media has different viewpoints when evaluating its future potential. Many draw attention to worries about losing particular professions, including journalism and white-collar office work, and how cheating would destroy the educational system. On the contrary, others' beliefs range from that the program will be helpful under these settings to understanding that the program is far from accurate in predicting correct answers. However, one thing is for sure, A.I. is here to stay and will continue to progress in the coming years. The purpose 
                of this essay is to analyze prominent news sources in their views of the rising chatbot- ChatGPT using the framing analysis.  <a href= file:///C:/Users/saiya/Downloads/Information_Media%20Analysis%20Paper%20-%20Riddhi%20Patel%20(1).pdf  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read here</a>

            <h2 class="subheader2">Classical Computationalism vs. Connectionism</h2>
            <p3 style="font-size:18px">
                When studying the philosophy of mind, the link between technology and the human mind is examined, with emphasis on two prominent theoretical models of Connectionism and Classical Computationalism. According to Connectionism, the human mind is understood best as an electrically communicating network of neurons rather than as a digital computer. Conversely, Computationalism is predicated on the notion that the mind functions similarly to an algorithm in a digital computer, manipulating symbols to produce meaning and actions. However, empirical data from the field of neuroscience supports the Connectivist viewpoint and delivers successful replication as seen with current generative Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) models.

                Here, this paper aims to examine and understand both theoretical models of the mind- Connectionism and Classic Computationalism, address the main argument why Connectionism helps us comprehend how the mind works, and address potential drawbacks as well as counter arguments against this idea.  <a href= file:///C:/Users/saiya/Desktop/project%201/MMP%20Final%20Paper-%20Riddhi%20Patel.pdf target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read here</a>
